    "## Algorithm\n",
    "- An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or a set of rules designed to perform a specific task or solve a particular problem.\n",
    "- Algorithms are essential in computer science and mathematics, as they provide a clear method for solving problems in a finite amount of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Characteristics of Algorithms\n",
    "- **Finite**: An algorithm must always terminate after a finite number of steps.\n",
    "- **Definite**: Each step of the algorithm must be precisely defined and unambiguous.\n",
    "- **Input**: An algorithm has zero or more inputs, which are the initial data given before the algorithm starts.\n",
    "- **Output**: An algorithm has one or more outputs, which are the results produced by following the steps of the algorithm.\n",
    "- **Effective**: The steps of the algorithm must be basic enough to be performed, in principle, by a person using only pencil and paper. Each step must also be achievable in a finite amount of time.\n",

    "### Types of Algorithms\n",
    "- **Simple Recursive Algorithms**: Algorithms that solve the base case directly and solve the larger problem by breaking it down into smaller instances of the same problem.\n",
    "- **Backtracking Algorithms**: Algorithms that try different possibilities until a solution is found.\n",
    "- **Divide and Conquer Algorithms**: Algorithms that divide the problem into smaller subproblems, solve each subproblem recursively, and combine the solutions.\n",
    "- **Dynamic Programming Algorithms**: Algorithms that solve problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and storing the results of subproblems to avoid redundant computations.\n",
    "- **Greedy Algorithms**: Algorithms that make the locally optimal choice at each step with the hope of finding the global optimum.\n",
    "- **Brute Force Algorithms**: Algorithms that try all possible solutions to find the correct one.\n",
    "- **Randomized Algorithms**: Algorithms that use random numbers to influence the choices they make during their computation."
