    "## Procedural Oriented Approach\n",
    "- Procedural Programming approach focuses on writing code in a sequential manner, where the program is divided into procedures or functions that perform specific tasks. \n",
    "![Iamge](Image/m.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Drawbacks of Procedural Programming:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lack of Modularity:** Procedural code can become monolithic and difficult to break down into smaller, manageable modules.\n",
    "- **Limited Reusability:** Code reusability is limited compared to OOP, leading to potential code duplication and maintenance issues.\n",
    "- **Global State:** Relying heavily on global variables can lead to bugs and unexpected behavior due to shared state.\n",
    "- **Complexity:** Managing program complexity becomes more challenging as the program grows, making it harder to understand and debug.\n",
    "- **Poor Data Encapsulation:** Data may not be well-encapsulated, increasing the risk of accidental data modification and reducing code reliability.\n"

    "## OOPS Concepts \n",
    "- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python are fundamental for understanding how to structure and organize code.\n",
    "- OOP can make software development more modular, reusable, and maintainable, which can make it easier to upgrade and update the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of OOPs\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Modular Development:**\n",
    "    - OOP lets us build programs like putting together puzzle pieces that fit perfectly. We use pre-made modules (classes) that work together, saving time and making development faster.\n",
    "- **Problem Solving Made Easy:**\n",
    "    - OOP breaks big problems into smaller, manageable pieces. We solve each piece (object) one at a time, making the overall task less daunting.\n",
    "- **Higher Productivity and Quality:**\n",
    "    - OOP tools help programmers work faster and create better-quality software. This means less time spent fixing errors later on.\n",
    "- **Scalability:**\n",
    "    - OOP systems grow easily. We can start small and expand without major rewrites, which is like adding rooms to a house without tearing down walls.\n",
    "- **Isolated Instances:**\n",
    "    - OOP allows multiple instances of objects to exist without interfering with each other. It's like having separate cars that don't affect how others drive.\n",
    "- **Efficient Project Management:**\n",
    "    - OOP helps divide work in a project based on objects. It's like organizing a team where each person has a specific role.\n",
    "- **Mapping Real-World Problems:**\n",
    "    - OOP lets us map real-world problems directly to program solutions. For example, a car object in a program mirrors a real car in the world.\n",
    "- **Data Security:**\n",
    "    - OOP's data hiding feature keeps sensitive information secure. It's like having a locked box that only certain people can access.\n",
    "- **Code Reusability:**\n",
    "    - OOP's inheritance feature allows us to reuse code and extend existing classes easily. It's like using a blueprint for building multiple houses with slight variations.\n",
    "- **Simpler Communication:**\n",
    "    - OOP uses message passing between objects, making communication clear and interfaces with other systems straightforward. It's like speaking a common language that everyone understands.\n",
    "- **Detailed Model Implementation:**\n",
    "    - OOP's data-centered design captures more details of a model in a way that can be implemented directly. It's like having a detailed plan for building something, making the actual construction smoother.\n",

    "### Name Mangling\n",
    "- Python doesn't block access to private data, it just leaves for the wisdom of the programmer, not to write any code that access it from outside the class. \n",
    "- We can still access the private members by Python's name mangling technique.\n",
    "- Name mangling is a technique in Python where identifiers prefixed with double underscores `(__)` are automatically modified by the interpreter to avoid naming conflicts in subclasses. \n",
    "- This process changes the name of the variable to include the class name, preventing accidental overriding or access from subclasses.\n",
    "- Name mangling is the process of changing name of a member with double underscore to the form `object._class__variable`. Ex: `e1._Employee__age`\n",
    "- If so required, it can still be accessed from outside the class, but the practice should be refrained.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Here's how name mangling works:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Variable Renaming:** When an identifier is prefixed with double underscores within a class definition, Python automatically renames it by adding _ClassName at the beginning of the identifier, where ClassName is the name of the class defining the variable.\n",
    "- **Access Modification:** Variables with name mangling are still accessible within the class where they are defined, but their names are altered to prevent direct access from outside the class or from subclasses.\n",
    "- **Preventing Name Clashes:** Name mangling helps in preventing accidental name clashes in subclasses, especially when subclasses define variables or methods with the same name as those in the superclass."

    "- Inheritance in Python allows a class (child class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent class). \n",
    "- This concept is fundamental in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) as it promotes code reusability and supports the creation of hierarchical class structures.\n",
    "- In inheritance, the child class acquires the properties and can access all the data members and functions defined in the parent class. A child class can also provide its specific implementation to the functions of the parent class.\n",
    "- In python, a derived class can inherit base class by just mentioning the base in the bracket after the derived class name `class derived-class(base class) : <class>`\n",
