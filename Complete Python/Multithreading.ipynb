    "## Multithreading\n",
    "- By default, a computer program executes the instructions in a sequential manner, from start to the end. \n",
    "- Multithreading refers to the mechanism of `dividing the main task in more than one sub-tasks` and executing them in an overlapping manner. \n",
    "- This makes the `execution faster` as compared to single thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In Python, multithreading is a technique used to `execute multiple threads concurrently within a single process`. \n",
    "- Threads are lightweight, independent units of execution that share the `same memory space`, allowing them to run concurrently and perform tasks in parallel. \n",
    "- However, Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) restricts true parallelism for CPU-bound tasks, but it's still useful for I/O-bound tasks like network operations or file I/O."
